title: "Sewing Machine Quick Start Guide"
permalink: /SMQSG

This guide assumes that you have some experience with sewing and its relevant terminology and that you have a manual for you sewing machine on-hand. This is more of a collection of tips and things to keep in mind when using a sewing machine, especially if you've never used one before.

Refer to your machine's manual for unfamiliar terminolgy related to sewing machine parts

# Sewing Machine Workflow

## Pin pattern pieces together

1. pins should be perpendicular to the direction of the seam. 
2. **NEVER SEW OVER PINS. Remove the pins before they reach the presser foot. The needle can break off if it hits a pin**

## Thread the machine

Sewing machines have a top and bottom thread. 

### Top Thread

There are pictures on both the machine and in the manual to direct you where to put the thread.

1. **The needle must be at its highest position. Rotate the hand wheel towards you (counter-clockwise if you are staring at the side of the machine with the wheel) until the needle reaches the correct point. The metal hook on the inside of the machine (called the takeup lever arm) will also be at the highest point.**
2. The needle must be threaded from the front to the back
3. Leave at least around 4 inches of thread behind the needle

### Bottom Thread

1. The spool in the bottom is called a bobbin. Make sure to buy the correct type (metal vs plastic). The one that came with your machine will be the correct one.
2. The metal holder for the bobbin is called the bobbin case. It often has a flap with a screw that the bobbin thread needs to be secured under. This controls the tension of the bottom thread.
3. The orientation of the bobbin matters. See the manual for which direction you must insert it.
4. When inserting the bobbin case with bobbin into the machine, There's a little handle on the bobbin case you can hold. This handle is also responsible for "unlockihg" the bobbin case from the machine.
5. **Reloading a bobbin** —> see manual. There are also pictures on the top of the machine showing you where to put the thread for this
    1. When you run out of bottom thread, you can wind new thread onto it yourself.
        1. The needle should not be moving while you wind the bobbin.
        2. Most bobbins have a small hole near the center that you can thread from the inside out so that you can prevent the bobbin from unwinding in the very beginning.
6. After both parts are threaded, make sure to hand crank at least one stitch so that you can drag the bottom thread up  through the needle plate. You should keep about a 4in tail so that the needle doesn’t un-thread itself on your first stitch.

## Stitch

1. Place the fabric under the presser foot and check where the needle is hitting so that it matches the seam allowance you want. The needle plate has markings showing you where each distance is.
2. Lower the presser foot. There should be a lever in the back to do this
3. Press on the foot pedal to start sewing. **Stop after the first 4-5 stitches then, while holding the reverse lever, sew back to the start.** This is called **backstitching** and is required to ensure that the thread doesn’t unravel. Release the reverse lever once you are done backstitching
4. Continue sewing the rest of the seam.
    1. Tip: Hold the fabric in front and behind the machine, not the front and side. keep track of the fabric alignment *before* the needle to get straighter seams.
5. **Backstitch the end of the seam**
6. Lift the presser foot and cut thread

## Sewing techniques

### Corners
1. Sew up to the corner and make sure that the eye of the needle is below the fabric. If the needle is not below the fabric, turn the hand wheel towards you until it is. You may need to lift the presser foot so as not to overshoot the corner.
2. Lift the presser foot and **rotate** the fabric about the needle. Once the fabric is going the direction you want it to, put the presser foot back down.
3. Continue sewing

### Pressing seams
Especially with clothes, it is often best to iron the seams. This makes your work neater and often makes the fabric easier to work with.

### Swatching
When working with new materials, it’s best to sew on a small rectangle using the fabrics and thread you will be working with so you can check if the tension/needle/thread is good.

### Turning the hand wheel away from you
Don't do this unless the machine is jammed and you need to free your needle. If you need to turn the hand wheel away from you for other reasons, at least make sure you're not doing a full rotation backwards, otherwise you will jam your machine.

# Tools

## Must haves

- Fabric shears OR a cutting mat with a rotary cutter. Having both is really nice. Regular shears will be quickly dulled by fabric\

## Nice to have

- sewing machine oil
    - machines should be oiled every few projects or so, but I get lazy
- Additional presser feet
    - Zipper foot, button feet
- extra bobbins because you don’t want to be forced to unwind one when switching colors

# Materials

## Easy to work with materials

- cotton
- muslin (commonly used for clothing mock-ups)
- linen
- canvas
- felt
- any fabric that is not stretchy or too silky or too thick

## Useful but situational materials

- Interfacing
    - This is a category of materials that, when attached to another material, can add strength, stability, and/or thickness to another. Usually a pattern will specify if it wants interfacing. I also use the iron-on types to reinforce mending on clothes.

## Materials that need special attention

- Stretchy materials (t-shirt, stretchy costume material, etc.)
    - You must use a ball-point needle, as regular needles catch and rip the threads, resulting in frequent dropped stitches and a very frustrating experience
- Thick materials (denim, etc.)
    - when sewing many layers of thick material, it can be easier to use the hand crank than to use the foot pedal.
    - Using a piece of cardboard at the beginning/end of a stitch to even out the presser foot on thick material can make it easier to work with.
    - You probably want to use a heavy-duty needle
- Super-thin fabrics (organza, tulle, etc.)
    - Consider putting a sheet of paper underneath the fabric to give the thread something to hold onto. Then rip the paper away after.
 
## Thread considerations
If you have extremely old thread, like thread inherited from your grandma, that thread is more likely to break and you would be better served with new thread on the sewing machine. I use old thread mostly for decorative stitching now.

Using all-purpose polyester thread is great for starting out, as it is relatively cheap and versatile. There are A LOT of [types of thread](https://www.sewingpartsonline.com/blogs/education/ultimate-thread-reference-guide-2) to choose from if all-purpose polyester is not suitable for your project.

# Cheap ways to practice controlling the machine

1. Grab a sheet of paper and write some huge letters on it in a thin pen/pencil. Sew the letters with or without thread.
2. Practice straight lines on scrap fabric
